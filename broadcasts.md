# Broadcasts

Broadcasts enable you to send messages to targeted audiences via topics. They can be scheduled to start at a specified time and can last for a predetermined duration.

Our libraries give you the option to subscribe and unsubscribe to topics on demand, making it very easy and flexible to target the right audience.

Topics are free text and can be anything, example of Topics:

* Announcements
* Free / Paid
* Platform (iOS / Android / Web)
* Testing / Debug

You can use Broadcasts to:

* Promote new features
* Notify users of on-going events
* Present offers to targeted customers
* Inform users of changes within your offering

More information on how to subscribe to topics can be found in the technical documentation for each platform:
