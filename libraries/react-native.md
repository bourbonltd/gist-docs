# React Native

### Installation

```bash
npm install @gistproduct/react-native
```

Open the `build.gradle` file located inside the `android` directory and add the Gist maven repository.

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://maven.gist.build' }
    }
}
```

Link the Gist pod with react native project

```bash
npx pod-install
```

### Setup

```javascript
import Gist from '@gistproduct/react-native';
```

Gist can be initialized anywhere within your app, the `organizationId` property can be retrieved from the Gist dashboard.

```javascript
Gist.setup("your-organization-id");
```

#### User Token

If your app is relying on Gistâ€™s webhook service to trigger in-app messages, a user token must be set. This user token should be generated by your services and set at any point during runtime, for example, login or registration.

```javascript
Gist.setUserToken("unique-user-token");
```

To clear the user token:

```javascript
Gist.clearUserToken();
```

#### Current Route

Gist is able to show messages when a user reaches a particular route within your product. This is completely optional but messages containing route rules will not be displayed unless the route matches.

In your route handler add:

```javascript
Gist.setCurrentRoute("users/home");
```

### Broadcasts

Broadcasts enable you to receive messages based on topics the client is subscribed to.

#### Subscribing

```javascript
Gist.subscribeToTopic("announcements");
```

#### Unsubscribing

```javascript
Gist.unsubscribeFromTopic("announcements");
```

#### Clear All Topics

```javascript
Gist.clearTopics();
```

### Event Handling

```javascript
const eventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(NativeModules.GistEventEmitter);

eventEmitter.addListener('onMessageShown', (message) => {
  console.log("Gist onMessageShown:");
  console.log(message.messageId);
});

eventEmitter.addListener('onMessageDismissed', (message) => {
  console.log("Gist onMessageDismissed:");
  console.log(message.messageId);
});

eventEmitter.addListener('onAction', (event) => {
  console.log("Gist onAction:");
  console.log(event.messageId);
  console.log(event.action);
  console.log(event.currentRoute);
});

eventEmitter.addListener('onError', (message) => {
  console.log("Gist onError:");
  console.log(message.messageId);
});
```

### Messages

To programmatically dismiss messages `Gist.dismissMessage()` can be used to dismiss any active modal message being displayed.

### Important

The current React Native implementation doesn't support message embedding or manual triggering of Gist messages, these features will be available at a later date.
