# Pricing

We love to keep things simple and our pricing model is no different. Once you're done trying out our product for free you can upgrade to **Pro**.

The plan starts at €99 and includes 1,000 sessions. Any additional session is charged at €0.015c and is valid for 30 days.

This means that if your messages are seen by 3,000 unique users in a month we will charge you: €99 + (€0.015 \* 2,000) = **€129**.

We **don't** charge per message. Sessions are generated per device and are valid for 30 days, during this period a user can receive multiple messages, only 1 session will be charged.

It is also important to know that we count a session when the user receives a message, meaning that if during a billing cycle no messages are viewed, only the base fee of the plan is charged.
